          1. Subscription Refunds
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you believe you were charged in error or experienced a technical
          issue, you may request a refund within 7 days of the charge.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white">
          2. Usage-Based Limitations
        </h2>
        <p>
          Refunds are not available for subscriptions where significant usage
          has already occurred, including completed audio analyses.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white">
          3. No Guaranteed Results
        </h2>
        <p>
          ViralPulse provides AI-generated insights. Results may vary and are
          not guaranteed. Dissatisfaction with output quality alone does not
          automatically qualify for a refund.
        </p>

          4. Abuse Prevention
        </h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to deny refund requests in cases of abuse,
          repeated refunds, or violation of our Terms.
